task 3: head rotation
A pivot joint allows rotational motion around a single axis, enabling the robot's head to tilt up and down or rotate left and right. By entering the robot's body, the inner circle represents the neck joint. The movement of the joint will be by using two electric DC motors, one for the X direction and the other for the Y direction. And they will work together when the robot moves towards a certain angle between the two axes
